# different things happen for each turn type as described in turn class
  # use turn class to figure out what type of turn and then change ourput depending on turn type
  # output needs to tell player what type of turn happened
# basic = winner gains 2 cards
# war = winner gains 6 cards
# mutually assured destruction = 6 cards removed from play
